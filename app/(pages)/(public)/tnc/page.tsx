          <p>
            These Terms and Conditions (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your use of the platform provided at www.amsafintech.com (the &quot;Platform&quot;) and form a binding legal agreement between the customer (&quot;you,&quot; &quot;your&quot;) and Amsa Fintech and IT Solutions Pty Ltd (ABN 671 931 776), operating under the name &quot;AMSA&quot; (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; &quot;our&quot;). By accessing, using, or clicking &quot;I agree&quot; to any services provided on the Platform, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted all of the terms outlined here, as well as our Privacy Policy.

          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">2. Amendments to the Terms</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms may be changed at any time, at our sole discretion, and will become effective immediately upon being published on the Platform. By continuing to use the Platform after changes are made, you agree to accept any new or revised terms. If you disagree with any updates, you should stop using the Platform. We recommend checking these Terms regularly to stay informed about current terms and conditions for using the Platform.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">3. Description of the Platform</h3>
          <p>
            The Platform is operated by Amsa Fintech and IT Solutions Pty Ltd exclusively for Australian residents and is not intended for non-Australian residents. To access the Platform, you must place an order through Binance Australia, Huobi Global, or OKex to purchase digital currencies from us, and you must reside in or be incorporated in Australia as an individual, sole trader, partnership, or company.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Platform allows you to transfer AUD into an account generated on the Platform. To use these services, you must complete identity verification, also known as a Know Your Customer (KYC) check.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that AMSA does not provide digital currency trading, accounts, or wallets, nor custody for your digital currencies. By using the Platform, you acknowledge that you are responsible for managing your assets after your purchase order is complete.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">4. Risks of Purchasing Digital Currencies</h3>
          <p>
            Digital currencies carry high risk and require enhanced security measures. The digital currency market is more volatile than traditional financial markets, with constant value fluctuations. While you may see substantial gains, losses are equally possible. Unlike traditional currencies, digital currencies are not backed by a government or other legal entity and rely on blockchain technology for security. In times of crisis, no entity is responsible for minimizing losses in the digital currency market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since AMSA does not hold or custody the digital currencies you purchase, it is not responsible or liable once the purchase order is completed. Chargeback requests through your bank after order completion are illegal or fraudulent actions, and you agree to indemnify AMSA for any related losses, costs, or expenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            AMSA is not liable for digital currencies sent to an incorrect or incompatible wallet address or lost due to user error. It is your responsibility to ensure you only transfer to trusted parties, as transactions cannot be reversed. AMSA encourages you to use personal wallet services and take additional security precautions. We do not provide financial, tax, or legal advice and recommend consulting professional advisors before purchasing digital currencies.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">5. AUD Transfers</h3>
          <p>
            When transferring AUD for an order, the account you use must be held in the same name as your verified account on Binance Australia, Huobi Global, or OKex. You are responsible for monitoring your account transactions, including any that are pending, canceled, or have failed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entering the correct BSB and account number for any AUD transfer is your responsibility. AMSA is not responsible for funds sent to an unintended recipient due to user error. Market volatility, technical issues, or other conditions may prevent us from completing orders; in these cases, we may refund transfers without liability for price fluctuations.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we reasonably suspect a transaction may involve fraud, money laundering, terrorism financing, or other violations of laws or policies, we reserve the right to suspend, delay, or cancel the transaction.
          </p>
